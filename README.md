# Model Selection and Evaluation Techniques in Machine Learning
This repository contains two Kernel SVM models

## The Dataset
The dataset is a simple dataset that uses a person's age and salary to classify whether or not the person would purchase a product from a certain advertisement.

## The Model
The model used in both techniques is a Support Vector Machine with a Kernel. This model is used as it had the highest accuracy for the dataset in comparison to other classification models.

## k_fold_cross_validation.ipynb
This file contains a Kernel SVM that uses a **k-Fold Cross Validation** algorithm to accurately evaluate the model.

## grid_search.ipynb
This file contains a Kernel SVM that uses a **Grid Search** algorithm to improve the accuracy of evaluating the model and finding the best parameters to increase model accuracy and performance.

## Both files make use of necessary libraries in Python as listed below
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciKit Learn
