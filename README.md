# Model-Selection-Machine-Learning
This repository contains two Kernel SVM models

## k_fold_cross_validation.ipynb
This file contains a Kernel SVM that uses a **k-Fold Cross Validation** algorithm to accurately evaluate the model.

## grid_search.ipynb
This file contains a Kernel SVM that uses a **Grid Search** algorithm to improve the accuracy of evaluating the model and finding the best parameters to increase model accuracy and performance.

## Both files make use of necessary libraries in Python as listed below
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciKit Learn
